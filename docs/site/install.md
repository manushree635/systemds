This guide helps in the install and setup of SystemDS from source code.

## Windows

TODO

## Build from source on Ubuntu 20.04

### Java and Maven

First setup java and maven to compile the system note that the java version is 1.8.

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless
sudo apt install maven
```

Verify the install with:

```bash
java -version
mvn -version
```

This should return something like:

```bash
openjdk version "1.8.0_252"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_252-8u252-b09-1ubuntu1-b09)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.252-b09, mixed mode)
Apache Maven 3.6.3
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 1.8.0_252, vendor: Private Build, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "5.4.0-37-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"
```

### Testing

R is required to be install to run the test suite, since many tests are constructed to comprare output with common R packages.
One option to install this is to follow the guide on the following link: <https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-20-04/>

At the time of writing the commands to install R 4.0.2 are:

```bash
sudo apt install dirmngr gnupg apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu focal-cran40/'
sudo apt install r-base
```

## Build the project

To compile the project use:

```bash
mvn package -P distribution
```

After some time it should return with:

```bash
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  31.730 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-18T11:00:29+02:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The first time you package the system it will take longer since maven will download the dependencies.
But successive compiles should become faster.

Now everything is setup and ready to go!
